# user-files

This directory stores input and output data for the automation script.

Files that may appear here:

- `models.csv` – optional whitelist for proper model naming.
- `RawModelUsageData.json` – raw API response saved when the script runs.
- `usage_data.csv` – tabular usage information.
- `usage_data.xlsx` – the same data formatted into Excel sheets.

Generated files are ignored by git so you can safely run the script locally.
