# AI-Horde-Popular-Tag-Automation-Tool

This repository contains a small script for updating the model whitelist used
by the AI Horde. By default all input and output files are placed in a folder
named `user-files` inside the project directory. Copy your `models.csv` file
into this directory before running the script. After execution, the updated
CSV and the downloaded usage data will also be saved there.
